<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm an aspiring web developer, learning a futureproof skill. In spite of AI
  taking over so many aspects of the tech field, I believe this still has a
  bright future in terms of financial stability. Oh, and it's fun!
</p>

<p>
  I have a background in game development using Unity and C# although nothing
  substantial enough to feel comfortable doing it for a living. But it's a hobby
  that can help me become a better coder and problem solver, which are critical
  skills in this industry.
</p>

<p>
  I've completed my html training, and am preparing to move on to CSS, which
  while intimidating to me right now, will upgrade my web skills to a level
  beyond anything I can imagine right now. To the journey!
